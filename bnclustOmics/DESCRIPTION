Description: This package can be used for Bayesian network-based clustering of multi-omics data. Both binary and continuous data types
    are allowed as inputs. The package serves a dual purpose: it clusters patient samples and learns the multi-omics networks that characterize discovered
    clusters. Prior network knowledge (e.g. from interaction databases) can be included via blacklisting and 
    penalization matrices. The output includes membership vector, cluster-specific MAP networks, and posterior probabilities
    of all edges in all networks. In addition to likelihood, AIC and BIC scores are returned.
